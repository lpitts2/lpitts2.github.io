	<p span class="map">Concept maps are tools for organizing and representing knowledge. They include concepts, usually enclosed in circles or boxes of some type, and relationships are indicated by a connecting line between two concepts. Words on the line specify the relationship between the two concepts. Novak, J. D. (2004). Concept Maps and How To Use Them. Insight, 6(2), 15â€“16. DOI: 10.1002/inst.20046215.</p><p span class="map"> A concept map is a diagram that highlights relationships between concepts and is the first step in creating an ontology. (<a href="file:///C:/Users/lrpit/OneDrive/Documents/school%20work/Spring%202020/IST%20300X/final%20project/ontology.html">Ontology</a>). Each concept links to the next via linking phrases, and are displayed in a hierarchical display, with each main concept being larger and then divided into sub-concepts as pieces of the larger whole.</p>
