    <h2> Concepts in Information Organization </h2>
  <p span class="map">
	Organizing System is an intentionally arranged collection of resources and the interaction they support. Listed below are some terms we learned this semester in regards to organizing information. Each term builds onto the next one, we talked about searching for information, then how to organize that information in a fast retrieval system (database). The next step was analyzing information to be presented in a visual layout showing how the different concepts are related.</p><p span class="map">The website is broken down into a home page, which displays our vocabulary terms and links to their individual page. Each page will list a definition of the term and provide a short description of how the term was implemented during class. A pictorial image will be included to display the term</p>
