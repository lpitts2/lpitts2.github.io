		Accessibility is the practice of designing and developing websites and applications such that their presentation, content and functionalities are understandable and operable by as many people as possible. </p><p span class="map"> Accessibility is the ability to use a resource regardless of any experience, wealth, or ability (inclusive, diverse, and equitable). There are several factors that need to be taken into account when making a website that is accessible to as many people as possible. The simplest to cover is readability. By choosing a clear readable font in a size large enough to be read and in good contrast to the background (as well as offering the ability to change font size) people with vision impairments are more able to use the site. Having a reader enables those without vision or the cognitive ability to read. </p>
