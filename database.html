		(2nd definition) A database is a collection of data organized as meaningful information that can be accessed, managed, stored, queried, sorted, and reported. </p><p span class="map">The simplest form of a database is a text database also known as a flat-file. Each line of text holds one record with fields separated by delimiters, such as commas or tabs. The next form of a database would be considered a desktop database because they are usually intended for a single user, examples include Microsoft Access or Excel. The most common database is a relational database, it allows for multiple users to work with the data at the same time. Examples of a relational database would include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, Sybase, Informix, and MySQL. The latest database is considered NoSQL and object-oriented databases.</p>
